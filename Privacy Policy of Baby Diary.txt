Welcome to Baby Diary ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the Baby Diary mobile application (the "App").
1. Information We Collect (and What We Don't)
Data You Provide for the Diary: The primary function of Baby Diary is to allow you to record information about your baby. This data is stored locally on your device. If you choose to use features that sync or back up your data to your personal cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive), this data will be managed by you through your account with that third-party service, subject to their privacy policy and terms. We do not store your baby's diary entries on our own servers.
Information for Google Sign-In (If Applicable): If you choose to sign in using your Google account, we will receive basic profile information from Google, such as your name, email address, and profile picture, as permitted by Google and your privacy settings with Google. This information is used solely for authentication purposes and to personalize your experience within the App (e.g., displaying your name). This information is subject to Google's Privacy Policy.
Information Collected by Google AdMob: We use Google AdMob to serve advertisements within the App. Google AdMob is a third-party advertising service provided by Google. AdMob may collect and use certain information about you and your device to provide personalized advertising. This may include:
Device identifiers (such as a resettable advertising ID like IDFA for iOS or Android Advertising ID)
IP address
Information about your device, such as device type, operating system, and mobile network information
Information about your interaction with ads served through the App.
The collection and use of this information by Google AdMob are governed by Google's own Privacy Policy, which you can find here: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads and https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543.
2. How We Use Your Information
To Provide and Maintain the App: To allow you to use the features of Baby Diary.
For Authentication (If Google Sign-In is used): To verify your identity and allow access to your diary data if synced via your Google account.
To Serve Advertisements: Information collected by Google AdMob is used to serve relevant advertisements to you.
3. Sharing of Your Information
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties, except as described herein:
Google AdMob: As mentioned, Google AdMob collects information for advertising purposes. We do not control how Google uses this information.
Google Sign-In / Google Drive (If Applicable): If you use these services, your data is shared with Google according to their terms and privacy policies.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent fraud, act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the App, or protect against legal liability.
4. Third-Party Services
The App uses third-party services, notably Google AdMob for advertising, and potentially Google Sign-In and Google Drive for authentication and data backup/sync. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services.
5. Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the information that is processed by the App. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of information. For data stored on your device or your personal cloud storage (like Google Drive), you are responsible for its security.
6. Children's Privacy
Baby Diary is intended for use by parents or legal guardians to record information about their babies. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold as required by applicable law). If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.
7. Your Choices and Opt-Outs (Advertising)
You can often opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by checking the settings for your device (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt-out of Interest-Based Ads" or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android) and/or by visiting the advertising industry's opt-out pages (e.g., NAI, DAA).
8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website (if applicable) and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
