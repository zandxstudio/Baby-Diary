  <h1>Privacy Policy of Baby Diary</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 5/13/2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to Baby Diary ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the Baby Diary mobile application (the "App").</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect (and What We Don't)</h2>
  <p><strong>Data You Provide for the Diary:</strong> The primary function of Baby Diary is to allow you to record information about your baby. This data is stored locally on your device. If you choose to use features that sync or back up your data to your personal cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive), this data will be managed by you through your account with that third-party service, subject to their privacy policy and terms. We do not store your baby's diary entries on our own servers.</p>

  <p><strong>Information for Google Sign-In (If Applicable):</strong> If you choose to sign in using your Google account, we will receive basic profile information from Google, such as your name, email address, and profile picture, as permitted by Google and your privacy settings with Google. This information is used solely for authentication purposes and to personalize your experience within the App (e.g., displaying your name). This information is subject to Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p><strong>Information Collected by Google AdMob:</strong> We use Google AdMob to serve advertisements within the App. AdMob may collect and use certain information about you and your device to provide personalized advertising. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (e.g., IDFA for iOS or Android Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Device type, operating system, and mobile network information</li>
    <li>Interaction with ads served through the App</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The collection and use of this information by Google AdMob are governed by Google's own Privacy Policy:<br>
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Policy</a><br>
    <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">Google AdMob Support</a>
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the App:</strong> To allow you to use the features of Baby Diary.</li>
    <li><strong>For Authentication:</strong> To verify your identity (if Google Sign-In is used).</li>
    <li><strong>To Serve Advertisements:</strong> Information collected by Google AdMob is used to serve relevant ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing of Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties, except as described:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> As mentioned above, AdMob collects data for advertising purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Sign-In / Google Drive:</strong> If used, your data is handled by Google per their terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or prevent fraud.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses third-party services such as Google AdMob, Google Sign-In, and Google Drive. These have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We are not responsible for their practices.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to secure your information. However, no system is completely secure. You are responsible for the security of data stored on your device or cloud account.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Baby Diary is for use by parents/guardians. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we learn such information has been collected, we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Choices and Opt-Outs (Advertising)</h2>
  <p>You may opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android) or visiting industry opt-out pages (e.g., NAI, DAA).</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted in the App or on our website. Please review this page regularly.</p>
